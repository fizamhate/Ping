nodemon is used so changes are updated automatically. dont have to kill the job and restart the server again.

Basically postman sends a request to the signup,etc endpoint. and then we parse the response we receive from that request.

A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure, compact, and self-contained way to transmit information between two parties, typically a client and a server. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
why do we need JWT?
